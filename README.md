# text-to-picture

## About

They say a picture is worth a thousand words. 

Why not both?

This project creates an image out of a text file where each pixel is represented by a character. Perhaps you want to take your code and transform it into a company logo. Maybe you'd like to make a graphic tee-shirt out of your favorite novel. Maybe you want to make a map of the world using each country's top google search strings.

## Try It Out
1. Download `text_to_picture.py`.
1. Fill out constants at the top of `text_to_picture.py`.
1. `LOGO_FILE` is the image you are going to textify.
1. `TEXT_FILE` is the source of the characters you're going to use for pixels.
1. `FONT_TYPE` is the font to use.
1. `FONT_SIZE` is how big each character is (how chunky the image is going to look)
1. Run `text_to_picture.py`.
