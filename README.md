# text-to-picture

## About

They say a picture is worth a thousand words.

This project creates an image out of a text file where each pixel is represented by a character. Perhaps you want to take your code and transform it into a company logo. Maybe you'd like to make a graphic tee-shirt of your favorite novel.
